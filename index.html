				I felt awkward as I dragged my unwieldy suitcase to my vintage car, loaded it into the trunk, and headed toward the airport. “Wouldn’t it be nice if I had someone to ride with me so I could use the high occupancy vehicle lane on the freeway?” I thought to myself. Unfortunately, according to the parlance of the DOT, it is compulsory to have at least two passengers, including the driver. Yep, it would sure expedite matters and be way more efficient than poking along in one of the outside lanes. I’m no hero, but I felt like Sir Lancelot displaying exceptional valour in the rush hour traffic when I stopped to help a fair damsel in distress. “What is a beautiful lady like you doing wandering around in the traffic?” I asked her. Near as I could ascertain, she had amnesia because she could neither answer my questions nor tell me her name. It was a mystery enough to bewilder anyone! I considered my options. Because of my record, if I took her to a police station, the cops would surely be tenacious in their questions and insinuations. Perhaps I would even end up getting arrested when all was said and done! I might need to hire a lawyer to arbitrate in my behalf or face punitive charges. Or, I could just head for the HOV lane now that there were two of us. Since, it had started to rain, I turned on my intermittent windshield wipers. It seemed to me the best thing to do was to patronise the airlines ticket counter for another ticket and take her with me. Luckily, I had my cheque book in my pocket, and she had a driver’s license in her purse for identification. And, that’s how I met my wife.
